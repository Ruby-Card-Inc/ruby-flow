# Ruby Fullstack Assignment

## Project Description

This is a basic react flow app that was cloned using the following command:

```bash
npx degit xyflow/vite-react-flow-template ruby-flow
```

Please look at [Installation and Requirements](https://reactflow.dev/learn/getting-started/installation-and-requirements) for more information

For the purpose of simplifying the backend for this assignment, we are going to use [Instant DB](https://www.instantdb.com/) to facilitate CRUD operations without the need of writing our own API. Instant DB is very similar to firebase.

## Task

Based on the image provided, which shows a workflow for a music subscription service, I can propose a similar AI workflow assignment related to financial accounts and spend control for a fintech application. Here's a concept:
Title: AI-Driven Spend Control and Financial Wellness Platform
This workflow would use React Flow to visualize the components and data flow of an AI-powered financial management system. Key elements could include:

User Onboarding

New user sign-ups
Financial goal setting
Initial budget creation

Transaction Categorization AI

Automatic categorization of expenses
Learning from user corrections

Spending Pattern Analysis

Weekly/monthly spending trends
Comparison to budget allocations

Smart Savings Recommendations

AI-generated savings opportunities
Personalized tips based on spending habits

Bill Payment Reminders

Upcoming bill notifications
Late payment prediction

Investment Suggestions

Risk profile assessment
Market analysis and recommendation engine

Credit Score Monitoring

Regular credit checks
Improvement recommendations

Fraud Detection System

Unusual transaction alerts
Location-based verification

Financial Education Module

Personalized learning paths
Quiz-based knowledge assessment

Virtual Financial Advisor

AI chatbot for financial queries
Scheduling with human advisors when needed

The workflow would show how data flows between these components, with metrics such as:

User engagement rates
AI prediction accuracy
Money saved through recommendations
Credit score improvements
Fraud prevention success rate

This concept combines AI, financial technology, and user-centric design to create a comprehensive spend control and financial wellness platform.
